# task1:
for recursion :
In this , code will takes integer as user input (n) and then i have define a function factorial(n),then i used if statement to set condition if n==0 or n==1 then it return 1 and if it is not true then use else statement it return n * (factorial(n-1)) and then last statment is to print the factorial.\n
for "for loop":
In this we do similar work takes user input as x and  define function factorial(x) but then we take a variable r and assign  value 1 to it, then using for loop of range(2,x+1) set r=r*i(i is iteration of the loop)
then return r and print the factorial 

# task2:
In this, code  i have import math module as m and then take n as user input (n is integer) ,and perform operation like squareroot (m.sqrt(n)), logarithm(m.log(n)) and sine(m.sine) and using print statement to print.
